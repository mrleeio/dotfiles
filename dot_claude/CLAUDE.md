# Claude Code Global Configuration

This file contains global preferences and directives that apply to all Claude Code sessions.

## Git Commits

**Always use the `conventional-commits` skill** when creating git commits. This ensures:
- Proper Conventional Commits formatting
- No AI attribution in commit messages
- Consistent commit history across all projects
